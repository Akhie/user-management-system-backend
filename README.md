# Project Idea: User Management System
Overview:<br/>
Build a simple User Management System that allows users to register, log in, view their profile, and update their details. The system will use JWT for secure authentication, and the frontend will be built in Vue.js, while the backend will be in Spring Boot.

## Key Features:
### User Registration:
The backend will store the user data securely, encrypting the password.<br/>

### User Login:
After registration, the user can log in using their email/username and password.<br/>
The backend will authenticate the user and return a JWT token if successful. <br/>

### JWT Authentication: 
On successful login, the backend will generate a JWT token containing user details and expiration time.<br/>
The backend will validate the JWT token for every protected API request.<br/>
If the token is valid, the user can access the protected routes; otherwise, they are denied access.<br/>

## Security Considerations:
Backend (Spring Boot):<br/>
Spring Security: Implement security configurations for JWT authentication.<br/>
JWT Library (e.g., jjwt): Create and parse JWT tokens.<br/>
Set up Spring Boot backend with necessary dependencies (Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, jjwt).<br/>
Create REST API endpoints for user registration, login, profile fetching, and updating.<br/>
REST Controllers: Expose endpoints for registration, login, profile view, and update.<br/>
User Entity & Repository: Define a User entity and interact with the database to manage users.<br/>
Exception Handling: Implement appropriate error handling for authentication and authorization failures.<br/>

## Bonus Features (Optional): To be implemented in future
Password Reset/Email Verification: Implement functionality for users to reset their password via email.<br/>
Role-based Authorization: Use JWT to manage user roles (e.g., Admin, User) and restrict certain actions based on roles.<br/>
Refresh Tokens: Implement refresh tokens to keep users logged in without having to constantly log in after the JWT expires.<br/>
This project will help you practice both frontend and backend development and solidify your understanding of secure authentication mechanisms like JWT.<br/>
